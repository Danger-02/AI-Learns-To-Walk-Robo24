# AI-Learns-To-Walk-Robo24

🏃‍♂️ AI Learns to Walk – Training & Visualization of AntBullet 🦿
This project trains an AI agent to walk using Reinforcement Learning in the AntBullet Environment (PyBullet). The trained model is then visualized in a Streamlit web interface, allowing real-time interaction and monitoring of the agent’s performance.

🚀 Features
✅ Reinforcement Learning: Trained using PPO/SAC in the AntBulletEnv-v0 environment.
✅ PyBullet Simulation: Physics-based locomotion training for realistic motion.
✅ Streamlit Dashboard: Interactive visualization of the trained agent.
✅ Customizable Training: Modify hyperparameters and training duration.
